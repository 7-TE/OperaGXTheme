# OperaGXTheme
 The orginal creator of this theme disapeared so here I am.
## Getting Started
 1. First download [OperaGX Theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/L-Ratio/OperaGXTheme/main/OperaRevival.theme.css).
 2. After you downloaded the theme put it in the folder. 
    - You can find the correct folder by going to Settings, Themes then clicking the "Open Themes Folder" button.
